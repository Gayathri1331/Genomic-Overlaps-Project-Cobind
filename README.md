# Cobind - Quantitative Analysis of Genomic Overlaps

## Overview

Cobind is a framework for analyzing transcription factor (TF) binding sites to explore genomic co-binding patterns. By utilizing statistical metrics such as Dice, Jaccard, NPMI, and PMI, this project aims to provide quantitative insights into regulatory genomic overlaps. The results of this analysis can aid in understanding the complex mechanisms of gene regulation and transcriptional control.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Combines multiple genomic datasets for transcription factor binding analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employs metrics (Dice, Jaccard, NPMI, PMI) to evaluate co-binding patterns.
- **Visualization**: Provides clear visual representation of co-binding relationships.
- **Custom Python Pipeline**: Built for efficient and reproducible genomic data analysis

## Installation

Install Cobind using pip:
```bash
$ pip install cobind
```
To upgrade to the latest version:
```bash
$ pip install cobind --upgrade
```
Uninstall
```bash
$ pip -y uninstall cobind
